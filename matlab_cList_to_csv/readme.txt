Just run createCsvFiles( experiment_dir) where experiment_dir is the path to the folder where the time directories are located (i.e. it contains folders such as t90-92/ , t120-124/, etc). Keep in mind that:

1. The path MUST contain the final /. i.e. 
	RIGHT: /home/gutiloluis/DESKTOP_OLD_LENOVO/Nov12_Segmented/
	WRONG: /home/gutiloluis/DESKTOP_OLD_LENOVO/Nov12_Segmented

2. experiment_dir MUST contain only the time directories, without other directories or files.
